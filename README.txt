THIS IS THE DOC FOR EXPLAINING THE SCREEN-FICHE PROJECT.
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS WEBSITE IS COMING AFTER THE REALIZATION OF TWO ACCOUNTS ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA: TIKTOK AND INSTAGRAM.

THIS PROJECT HAS FOR MISSION TO GIVE CONTENT WITH BEAUTIFUL ENERGY, MORAL AND MOTIVATION FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.
YES, IN THESE DARK TIMES WE HAVE MANY PROBLEMS BECAUSE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY DARK, BAD, AND SUPERFICIAL CONTENT.
90% OF THEM ARE BASED ON APPEARANCES, ON VIOLENCE, AND THE LOVE OF OUR EARTH AND BODY DISAPPEARS.
IT'S WHY I HOPE THE SCREEN-FICHE CONTENT WILL HAVE A GOOD IMPACT ON THE SOCIAL NETWORK.

***************************************************************************************

A SHORT RESUME OF WHAT IS SCREEN-FICHE: MANY VIDEOS OF POSITIVE THEMES (BODY/HEALTH/SPORTâ€¦) AND IN THE END OF THE VIDEO A "FICHE".
THE OBJECTIVE IS THAT THE CUSTOMER MAKES A SCREENSHOT AND HE CAN HAVE THIS FICHE ON HIS PHONE.

WE CAN MONETIZE THIS WITH SPECIAL EBOOKS LIKE "10 SCREEN-FICHE FOR COOK" OR "THE SCREEN-FICHE FOR ALL OF THE SPORTIVE PEOPLE".

THIS WEBSITE WILL BE CREATED WITH HTML/CSS/PHP.

THANKS FOR READING.
