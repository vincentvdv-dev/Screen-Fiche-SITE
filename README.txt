# Screen-Fiche

## Overview  
Screen-Fiche is the web companion to our TikTok and Instagram account, designed to deliver uplifting, motivational content to young audience.

## Mission  
In a social-media landscape too often dominated by superficial or negative content, Screen-Fiche aims to:  
- Inspire healthier habits (body, mind, sport, nutrition…)  
- Strengthen self-esteem and positivity  
- Provide shareable “takeaways” that stick beyond the scrolling feed

## How It Works  
1. **Watch** – User views a short, themed video on the site.  
2. **Grab** – At the end of the video, a “Get My Fiche” button appears.  
3. **Save** – User downloads or screenshots the “fiche”: a concise, beautifully designed tip sheet they can keep on their phone.

## Monetization Strategies  
- **Themed E-Books**: e.g. “10 Screen-Fiches for Healthy Cooking,” “Screen-Fiche Workout Guides”  
- **Premium Membership**: early access to new fiches, ad-free viewing, community perks  
- **Brand Partnerships**: sponsored fiches with health/fitness/wellness brands that align with our values

## Technology Stack  
- **Front-end**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Back-end**: PHP  
- **Database**: MySQL (or choose your preferred RDBMS)  
- **Hosting**: (to be decided)
